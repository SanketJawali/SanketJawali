I'm a tech enthusiast passionate about exploring the technology that shapes our daily lives. Currently, I'm advancing my web development skills through projects that tackle real-world challenges while also diving into low-level programming and learning Rust to better understand computers from the ground up. These projects have provided valuable insights into modern technology and its inner workings.

I enjoy deep dives into complex projects that push my limits, learning best by building from scratch. I strongly believe in the "reinventing the wheel" approach as the most effective way to master programming concepts and gain a deeper understanding.

I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for learning and growing. Let's collaborate and build something amazing!
